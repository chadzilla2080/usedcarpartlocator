############################### USED AUTO PART LOCATOR  ###############################

Purpose: 

The purpose of this script is to help users all over the planet locate used car parts, oem car parts, after market auto parts, on the open market place at a fair price. Transparency is needed to help get rid of manipulative sellers and brokers out there. The user deserves a better standard to information, power, and speed! 

Future Modifications:

Currently this script is under development. As one of my major builds using the Python and Flask Framework, this is just the beginning. I will probably reversion this into V1.0 sometime in the late Winter of 2016.

Python Version:

I'm using the Python3 version, so you'll need to install that.

Other Installs/Modules Needed:

To run this application you'll need to make sure you install these programs. If you have not installed Python3, I suggest you install that and a package installer::

1.) You'll need to install Python3, you can find a million tutorials on this, so I'm not going to cover that here. 

2.) This also runs GUnicorn

3.) Container ran with Docker


Suggestions:

If you have any suggestions of what you'll want to see in the future, please email me @ chadbuie@gmail.com. If I'm dead, then I'm very sorry and there's a small 
chance my wife my have archived any libraries of code that I have on a special server: http://www.codeyourlife.net

* I will have financed the server for up to 20 years after I've passed, hopefully someone will have the data archived in the web or waybackmachine!
